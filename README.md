## Problem Title
Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
A Web-Based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software is a dynamic and intelligent platform designed to revolutionize the selection and hiring process by integrating scenario-based simulations, AI-driven assessments, and real-time collaboration. This software enables organizations to create and customize various tests, including coding challenges, behavioral assessments, role-playing exercises, and problem-solving tasks that accurately gauge an applicant’s skills, decision-making ability, and adaptability. Applicants can create detailed profiles showcasing their experience, certifications, and professional links, while selectors can evaluate their performance using automated scoring, sentiment analysis in video interviews, and AI-driven matching algorithms that suggest the best-fit candidates. The platform supports multi-user collaboration, allowing multiple recruiters or hiring managers to assess applicants collectively, provide feedback, and discuss evaluations in real-time. Additionally, the system integrates seamlessly with HR software like Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, and Greenhouse, ensuring smooth workflow integration. Advanced analytics and reporting features provide deep insights into candidate performance, hiring trends, and skill gaps, enabling data-driven decision-making. The inclusion of gamification elements such as leaderboards, badges, and rewards encourages applicants to improve their skills, making the hiring or training process more engaging and competitive. Designed for businesses, recruitment agencies, and educational institutions, this software enhances efficiency, reduces hiring biases, and ensures a more accurate assessment of candidate potential in a simulated yet realistic environment.
